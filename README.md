# CalculatorApp
 
### This is a Calculator android application which performs some basic operation such as +, -, * or /. It also has a DEL button which removes the last added number or decimal(if present at last) and a CLR button which will clear everything from app so that we can start fresh. It also has a NEG button which toggles the sign of current number. Numbers are represented using EditText and operation is represented using TextView. I have also added saving and reloading facility for the  opperation which is currently happening when apps changes its orientation.
